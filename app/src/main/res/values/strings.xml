    <!-- FAQ -->
    <string name="a_faq0">What is lazy eye or amblyopia?</string>
    <string name="a_faq1">Treatment</string>
    <string name="a_faq2">Filter the image with the correct colors</string>

    <string name="a_faq3">What happens if I suffer strabismus?</string>
    <string name="a_faq4">Are games also beneficial for adults?</string>
    <string name="a_faq5">Is it backed by a medical authority?</string>
    <string name="a_faq6">Are the games aimed at minors?</string>
    <string name="a_ans0">The vague eye or amblyopia is the most frequent reason for vision loss among children and young people in developed countries and affects approximately 3\% of the population. It happens as a result of inadequate brain processing, because one of the eyes does not communicate well with the brain (it can be due to multiple causes such as strabismus, graduation differences between both eyes, anisometropia, aniseiconía, congenital cataracts) not reaching the optimal visual acuity, nor using the best optical correction. Which causes the weaker eye to be suppressed by the stronger eye. People with lazy eye do not have a developed percepcle of depth. It is very important to correct this visual defect during childhood (before 7 or 8 years), because if it is passed, the patient can completely lose the vision of the eye that does not use.</string>
    <string name="a_ans1">The treatment for amblyopia is to force the lazy eye to use. The most popular is for the child to wear the \'good\' eye patch for several hours every day for a few weeks or months. Once childhood is over, there is nothing to do for lack of cerebral plasticity.\nHowever, it has been found that play is effective in the treatment of amblyopia in adults, also known as \'lazy eye \', of According to new research.\nGaming information is shared by both eyes, forcing them to cooperate.\nWhen both eyes cooperate, the amblyopic brain can relearn as a result of an increase in the level of plasticity in the brain. Patients who played with both eyes experienced a significant improvement in their vision of the weaker eye after only two weeks.</string>
    <string name="a_ans2">These games can help you. With the right settings, applications can force the brain to use both eyes simultaneously to teach the brain proper image processing. Each part of the image is filtered only by one of the two eyes and this is achieved by filtering colors by putting on anaglyph glasses. Always make sure that only one of the eyes can see the left or right color. game requires that information be sent to both eyes to work cooperatively.</string>

    <string name="a_ans3">If you suffer from strabismus then you can NOT use this treatment because you may develop a double vision problem (diplopia). However, anyone can play games without anaglyph glasses simply for fun. You will find all the information in the "terms and conditions".</string>
    <string name="a_ans4">Yes, it has been discovered that these games are an effective exercise even for adults because they are based on teamwork of the eyes and force both of them to work together. In fact it is designed for adults suffering from amblyopia. Because traditional medicine only makes an early treatment until age 8 with the use of the patch, and after that age is considered impossible or very complicated. This is an alternative method for curing amblyopia for adults who feel encouraged to experiment with it.</string>
    <string name="a_ans5">It\'s not. It is an alternative therapy that is not supported by a professional but offers good results. First of all you must go to a professional and follow their instructions, we do not substitute the work of anyone. All this is stipulated in the \"terms and conditions\".</string>
    <string name="a_ans6">Yes of course. The games are suitable for all audiences in terms of gameplay and content. If you are a minor you must be under the supervision of an adult. All this is stipulated in the "terms and conditions".</string>
    <string name="b_faq0">Where do I begin?</string>
    <string name="b_faq1">What kind of 3d glasses can I use to play?</string>
    <string name="b_faq2">Can I change the side color filter if I prefer it?</string>

    <string name="b_faq3">I have normal prescription glasses, what should I do?</string>
    <string name="b_faq4">How long should I play the game?</string>
    <string name="b_faq5">How long should I play to see results?</string>
    <string name="b_faq6">My glasses do not filter completely in each eye</string>
    <string name="b_faq7">I have found an error or other unresolved doubt; or an idea to improve the experience</string>
    <string name="b_ans0">First go to the nut icon of the main menu or the game menu. Take the colored glasses you are going to use. Put on your glasses and select the color that corresponds to each eye. You can choose between six default colors or customize yours if you wish in the option \'Customized\'. Then you must select the side where your vague eye (Right or Left) is in the selection of the lazy eye. Finally, you have the option to activate or deactivate the sound in the games. Feel free to make all the settings you want. Even change the side of the \'Ojo vago\' if you wish. Click on the gamepad icon to go to the game menu and select the game you want and start playing.</string>
    <string name="b_ans1">The game works with any type of anaglyph 3D glasses.</string>
    <string name="b_ans2">You can change the side of the \'Eye-vague \' if you wish. The configuration of the \'lazy eye\' is designed so that with the vague eye you see the object in question that we consider \'center of attention \' and with the healthy eye the rest of the image. For example, in the Snake the vague eye will see the apple which we focus our attention on. In the Tetris the figure that we are moving. But you can do the test after playing about two weeks to see how it goes.</string>

    <string name="b_ans3">You must use a 3D anaglyph (if you have prescription glasses, then you should wear 3D glasses on it).</string>
    <string name="b_ans4">The recommended daily time can range from a minimum of 10–20 minutes to a maximum of 45–60 minutes each day. You can divide that into 2 or more sessions of 10–20 minutes if you feel more comfortable. The most important thing is to be able to concentrate on the time frame while exercising, so if you get tired rest a bit and continue later or, sometimes, you can skip a day to give your brain enough time to adapt the new entries.</string>
    <string name="b_ans5">At the beginning I recommend between 10 and 20 minutes per day for two weeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment. Later, if it convinces you, you can increase the daily time if you notice improvements.</string>
    <string name="b_ans6">If you have trouble configuring the colors after reading the instructions, you probably have low contrast 3D glasses. A higher contrast (darker) lenses are easier to configure so that colors are invisible, with low contrast glasses you must choose a very bright color to achieve that. This is the reason why high contrast or darker lenses fit the game better. You can also try to customize the colors in the selection of colors in the configuration option \'Customized \'. If it still does not work, it would be advisable to use other glasses.</string>
    <string name="b_ans7">If you have any questions, leave us a review on the shop store page commenting your concern. Before we had a contact email, but we have seen that most of you have preferred to communicate through the reviews of the store page of the Play Store. Taking into account that the questions and answers from previous reviews can be useful, we have decided that the contact will be made in this way. You can access directly by clicking on the floating icon of the text bubble. Be as clear and concise.</string>

    <string name="c_faq1">How can I change my profile data?</string>
    <string name="c_faq2">How can I see my activity?</string>

    <string name="c_faq3">How to close session?</string>
    <string name="c_faq4">Can I delete my account at any time?</string>
    <string name="c_ans0">With a registered account you will have a personalized profile and access to all your history of games from any device you access with your account. You will also have access to your best brands and see your progress, as well as how to share the best brands with the community. That\'s how we all encourage ourselves a little more!</string>
    <string name="c_ans1">In the icon of the person in the main menu you can edit your profile information.</string>
    <string name="c_ans2">On the clock icon. Inside you will see several general statistics. You can click on the "My History" button to see all your game history.</string>
    <string name="c_ans3">Press the off button on the main menu to log out.</string>
    <string name="c_ans4">Of course yes. At any time you can request the cancellation of the account.</string>

    <string name="aviso_estrabismo">There have been several people who have asked us if this application can be used to treat strabismus. Due to your concern (and ours) about the doubts that this problem concerns, if you suffer from strabismus, please read this before using the application.

    \n\nThis application is designed to treat amblyopia slightly, that is, they are exercises that allow you to continue exercising the lazy eye in adults, being able to slightly correct the problem. But we start from having a healthy eye and a lazy eye. Being a problem of strabismus (in many cases triggering a problem of amblyopia due to loss of vision in one of the two eyes), the deviation of the eyes is too pronounced and in this case it can be harmful. Because this application is part of an experimental therapy, we cannot and do not have the right to be able to recommend it to people with strabismus if we cannot guarantee 100% of any adverse effects.

    \n\nIn the event that you suffer from a very very mild strabismus, you could assess yourself by trying it for a couple of weeks. But please, consult an opticians professional for better advice.

    \n\nIf in the future we know more about it, we will keep you informed.

    \n\nA cordial greeting.</string>
